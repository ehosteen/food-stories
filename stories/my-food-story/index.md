# Thanksgiving at My Great Grandma’s
Every year my family heads over to my dad’s grandma’s place for Thanksgiving. It’s tradition that before we eat, she gives the prayer in Navajo. That moment always sets the tone for the whole day — it’s not just about the food, it’s about family, gratitude, and carrying on something bigger than us.

## Gathering the Family
This year I had just come back home the day before Thanksgiving. I slept in late, finishing up assignments since the semester was almost over, and then rushed to get ready while my mom, dad, and two brothers were already moving around. Luckily, my great grandma doesn’t live too far, so we made it in time.
When I walked in, I got to see cousins, uncles, aunties, and grandma. Not everyone made it this year, but the ones who did made it special. They asked how I was doing in college, told me how proud they were that I’m working on my BBA so young, and teased me about whether I’ve gotten a girlfriend yet. I laughed and told them I’m focused on surviving on my own, paying rent, and keeping up with classes.

### The Prayer
By the time we finished catching up, the food was ready. But before anyone touched a plate, we all gathered together and went quiet. My great grandma stood up and spoke in Navajo to the older family members. Later, my mom explained she was saying how proud she was of everyone, how thankful she was for those who came, and even gave thanks for those who couldn’t make it. Then she gave her prayer — a blessing for protection, good luck, and safety.

#### The Feast
After that, we finally dug in. Turkey, enchiladas, frybread, and yams (my favorite). It wasn’t just a meal; it was a reminder of who we are, where we come from, and how we keep each other going.

## Analysis: Language, Family, and Belonging

What stands out in this story is how Thanksgiving isn’t centered on the food itself but on the prayer. The meal is important, sure, but the real meaning comes from my great grandma’s words in Navajo. That moment shifts the holiday from just eating together to honoring family, heritage, and resilience. It shows how food traditions often carry deeper meaning — they’re about identity, memory, and belonging.
The Navajo language makes the prayer even more powerful. It keeps our culture alive across generations, even when younger family members like me need a translation. That’s what we’ve talked about in class as embodied knowledge — traditions passed down through lived experience, not written down in books. Just like recipes can hold history, prayers carry values of gratitude, protection, and resilience.
The family conversations before the meal also matter. My relatives reminded me that food gatherings are about more than eating — they’re about encouragement, teasing, and support. They connect my personal journey in college to the larger family story. That’s community in action: food as the backdrop for affirming identity and strengthening bonds.
Inclusivity shows up in the prayer too. My great grandma gave thanks not only for those who were there but also for those who couldn’t make it. That expands the circle, showing that family ties go beyond physical presence. It’s a kind of cultural hospitality, where everyone is included in the blessing whether or not they’re at the table.
Finally, the food itself — turkey alongside enchiladas, frybread, and yams — reflects the blending of traditions. It’s both mainstream American Thanksgiving and distinctly Navajo/Southwestern. That mix shows how American foodways are layered, diverse, and constantly adapting.
In the end, Thanksgiving in my family is about continuity and belonging. The prayer, the language, the food, and the conversations all come together to make the holiday more than just a meal. Oral histories like this capture what written archives miss: the emotions, the blessings, and the everyday practices that make culture feel alive. For me, that single Thanksgiving is a microhistory of American food — rooted in Indigenous heritage, layered with family tradition, and full of meaning that goes way beyond the plate.
